Computer Science Student | Passionate About Technology and Development

Currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science, Iâ€™m always looking to learn and gain new experiences in the tech field. Iâ€™m interested in software development, data structures, and artificial intelligence.

Although I don't have professional experience yet, Iâ€™ve worked on academic and personal projects using languages such as Java, Python, and C. I also have knowledge in web development with HTML and CSS, and Iâ€™m improving my skills in frameworks for graphical interfaces.

Iâ€™m open to internship opportunities and collaborations to expand my knowledge and contribute with innovative solutions. Letâ€™s connect? ðŸš€
